# 🌊 AbyssGPT  
### Deep-Sea Intelligence Assistant for Mapping, Risk Analysis & Resource Planning

AbyssGPT is an interactive marine-intelligence system that analyzes deep-sea data layers such as hazards, biodiversity, corals, resources, currents, and seafloor topography.  
It supports natural-language queries, generates risk assessments, highlights resource-rich mining zones, and visualizes results on a dynamic map.

Built with **Python, Streamlit, NumPy, Plotly**, and a full custom backend logic engine.

## Features

### Natural-Language Query Engine**
Ask AbyssGPT things like:
- “Explain (10, 15)”
- “Find safe route from (2,3) to (10,15)”
- “Where are the best mining zones with low coral impact?”
- “Show biodiversity at (4,9)”
- “POI at (3,7)”

Our custom intent-classifier (no LLM dependency) routes each query to:
- Hazard analysis  
- Biodiversity / species lookup  
- Mining score analysis  
- Conservation heatmaps  
- Route-finding  
- Region explanations  

---

## Data Layers Used**
Stored in `/data/*.csv`:

| Layer        | Includes |
|--------------|----------|
| `cells.csv`  | Depth, temperature, biome |
| `currents.csv` | Speed, stability |
| `hazards.csv` | Vents, trenches, volcanism, severity |
| `corals.csv` | Health, cover %, biodiversity index |
| `resources.csv` | Abundance, value, impact |
| `life.csv` | Species, density, threat level |
| `poi.csv` | Landmarks & seafloor features |

Every query fetches data from these layers and builds a structured explanation.

---

## Map Visualization**
Uses Plotly to show:
- Depth map (default)
- Heatmaps for mining or conservation queries
- Route overlays
- Highlighted coordinates

---

## Backend Logic Overview**

### Scoring Engine (`logic/scoring.py`)
- **Danger Score** — depth, hazards, currents  
- **Resource Score** — abundance, value, purity  
- **Ecological Impact Score** — corals, life, environmental impact  
- **Combined Score** — weighted based on query:
  - Mining  
  - Conservation  
  - Safe-route navigation  
  - Balanced  

### Pathfinding (`logic/pathfinding.py`)
Uses a Dijkstra-style graph search to compute least-risk routes.

### Explanation Generator (`logic/explain.py`)
Turns raw numeric data into human-readable descriptions.

## Chat Interface**

Built using Streamlit native chat components:
- Clean chat bubbles
- Demo query shortcuts
- Stable input cycle with no duplicate messages
- Structured responses (answer + data source + important stats)
